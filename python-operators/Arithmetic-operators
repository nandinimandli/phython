# Define the variables
a = 15
b = 4

# Calculate sum
sum_ab = a + b

# Calculate difference
difference_ab = a - b

# Calculate product
product_ab = a * b

# Calculate quotient
# Using float division to get a decimal result
quotient_ab = a / b

# Print the results
print(f"Sum of {a} and {b} is: {sum_ab}")
print(f"Difference between {a} and {b} is: {difference_ab}")
print(f"Product of {a} and {b} is: {product_ab}")
print(f"Quotient of {a} divided by {b} is: {quotient_ab}")
